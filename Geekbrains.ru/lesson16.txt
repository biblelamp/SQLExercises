1. Full Outer Join / what to do in MySQL?

SELECT * FROM product_type WHERE id = 1
UNION
SELECT * FROM product_type WHERE id = 2;

SELECT * FROM `order`
	LEFT JOIN order_products ON order_products.order_id = `order`.id
	LEFT JOIN product ON order_products.product_id = product.id
UNION
SELECT * FROM `order`	
	INNER JOIN order_products ON order_products.order_id = `order`.id
	RIGHT JOIN product ON order_products.product_id = product.id
	WHERE `order`.id IS NULL;
