1. Aggregate Functions

SELECT * FROM product;

-- print count of records
SELECT count(*) FROM product WHERE product.price < 10000;

-- print sum of all goods, min and max price
SELECT sum(price) AS total_price, min(price) AS min_price, max(price) AS max_price FROM product;

2. Homework

USE shop;

INSERT INTO order_products (order_id, product_id, `count`) VALUES (2, 3, 2);
INSERT INTO order_products (order_id, product_id, `count`) VALUES (2, 4, 3);

SELECT sum(price * `count`) AS total_price FROM `order` 
	INNER JOIN order_products ON order_products.order_id = `order`.id
	INNER JOIN product ON product.id = order_products.product_id
	WHERE `order`.id = 2;
