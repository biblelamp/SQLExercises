1. Left/right Join

SELECT * FROM category
	INNER JOIN product on product.category_id = category.id;

-- print all records of category and crossing records from product
SELECT * FROM category
	LEFT JOIN product on product.category_id = category.id;

-- print record(s) which don't have connect with product
SELECT category.* FROM category
	LEFT JOIN product on product.category_id = category.id;
	WHERE product.id IS NULL;

-- get the same result as previous using right join
SELECT category.* FROM product
	RIGHT JOIN category on product.category_id = category.id
	WHERE product.id IS NULL;

2. Homework

INSERT INTO `shop`.`product_type` (`name`) VALUES ('иѓср');

-- print all product type which we don't have in product
SELECT product_type.* FROM product_type
	LEFT JOIN product ON product.product_type_id = product_type.id
	WHERE product.id IS NULL;

-- print all products which we don't have in order
SELECT product.* FROM `order`
	INNER JOIN order_products ON order_products.order_id = `order`.id
	RIGHT JOIN product ON order_products.order_id = product.id
    WHERE `order`.id IS NULL;
